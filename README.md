# 📈 Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project designed to predict stock price movements using historical data.  
The entire workflow — from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization — is documented in the Jupyter notebook included here.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The notebook (`NoteBook.ipynb`) covers the following steps:

- Collecting historical stock data  
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset  
- Engineering features and technical indicators  
- Training machine learning models  
- Evaluating performance using multiple metrics  
- Visualizing predictions vs. real prices

The project focuses on understanding how historical numerical patterns can be leveraged to forecast future trends, while acknowledging the natural uncertainty of financial markets.

## 🧠 Methods & Technologies

This project uses:

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

Model performance currently reaches around **45–55% accuracy**, depending on the time period and ticker — which is consistent with the difficulty of short-term forecasting.
